About:
‘Attack of the Bots’ is a top down 32 bit 2-Dimensional Sci-Fi Fighter where you play as a one of the very few survivors on earth from the invasion of rouge humanoid robots, your on a mission to the main headquarters of the organization to as which the human CEO is dead and you must shut them down and its manufacturing so the human population can grow again.

What Makes This Unique?
The game has similar ideas from other games and i dont see that very often, one game i have noticed that had a mix of other games is ‘Splitgate’ where it was a mix of ‘Portal’ and ‘Halo’ in its style, where my game is gonna have similar elements from games such as: Portal, Cyberpunk 2077, and Ultrakill.
